WEB ROLLER
The most accessible way to use this randomizer is the web roller here:
https://randorandy.github.io/VerticalityRando/

LOCAL DOWNLOAD
If you prefer an offline or custom experience, you may want to use python3 and roll locally:
1.download this repository
2.place a copy of the Redesign rom in the roms folder - it must be named Verticality1.3.sfc
3.run Main.py in console
This should create a randomized rom with the given name in the roms folder and a spoiler log (.txt) in the spoilers folder.

FAIR WARNING
Logic was written quickly and is kind of simplified for quick release. Seeds may be unbeatable or front-loaded (too easy). Contact me with logical issues.

GAMEPLAY NOTES
To prevent softlocks or issues I made a couple edits:
- The Glider location does not crumble the floor and lock you in. Instead, the item has been placed strategically so it can either be picked up without falling, or you can fall after collecting it.
- The door entering kraid from the right side (Speed Booster side) would normally lock you in a wall. Instead, the door into kraid from the right has been decoupled and wrongwarps you left of Kraid to avoid a softlock.

THANKS
Thanks to beauxq, and without the Subversion rando none of these other projects would have been possible for me:
